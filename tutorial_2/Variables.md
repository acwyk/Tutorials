# Variables

## What is a variable?
A variable is the most basic way to store some kind of data in a program which we intend to use. 

A variable can be many different things, like a string (collection of characters), numbers, boolean (true/false) and many others.

## The structure of a variable

A variable is structured like this:

```
<variable_name> = <value>
my_var = "Hello, world!"
```
the `=` is assigning our value to our variable name.
