# Data Types
In Python, there are _many_ types of data available to us. Some are simple (we use them every day) others require a little more thinking.

## What are data types?
Data types are, in programming, a structured way to represent data. In essence, it's the _type_ of data we're working with.

An example of a data type is a *string*. A string is a _string_ of characters (letters, numbers, special characters) chained together.


| Data type | Declaration (not in Python) | How It Is Represented | Conventional Example | Python Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|character | char | single quotes: `' '` | `char my_character = '#'` | `my_character = '#'`
|string | double quotes: `" "` | string of characters | `string my_string = "hello, world 1` | `my_string = "hello, world 1"` |
| Integer | int | whole number | `123` | `int my_number = 123` | `my_number = 123` |
| Long | long | whole number | `123456` | `int my_number = 123456` | `my_number = 123456` |
| Float | float | decimal number | `1.23` | `int my_number = 1.23` | `my_number = 1.23` |
| double | double | decimal number | `1.23456` | `int my_number = 1.23456` | `my_number = 1.23456` |
| Array | [] | list of items | `int[] my_array = [1, 2, 3]` | `int[] my_array = [1, 2, 3]` | `my_array = [1, 2, 3]` |

There are many, many more data types out there that more complex than the ones listed above.
