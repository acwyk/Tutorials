"""
Explanation:

The 'print' word is telling the computer to output what is inside the "()".
In our case, we're telling the computer to output the text "Hello, World!".

The text we're giving our "print" command is called a "string". 
A string is like a sentence, it can contain many words, letters, numbers, or
special chatacters like !@#$%.
